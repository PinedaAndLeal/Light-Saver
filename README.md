# Light-Saver
This is an app where it is based on a motion sensor where a light can be turned on
in case any movement is detected near said sensor and also an alarm is sent that
motion was detected. Also, the intensity with the illumination of the 
light will be changing when turning on.

# Objectives 
Light Saver is a project that has the porpuse of savings in electricity billing. Without a doubt, this is one of
its best advantages, since the sensors will only activate the lighting at the moment
the sensor detects movement. In this way, it is avoided to keep lights on uselessly
that only produces electricity consumption and an increase in energy bills.
Another objective of the use of these sensors is that they work as a landscape and 
are visually pleasing to the human eye by changing between the intensity of the light 
as well as its general illumination.
